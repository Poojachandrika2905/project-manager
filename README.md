Project Manager – Full Stack Application
Overview

This project is a full-stack web application developed as part of a full-stack development assignment.
The application consists of a landing page and an admin panel to manage projects, clients, contact form submissions, and newsletter subscriptions.

The system follows a clean separation of concerns with a React frontend and a Node.js + Express backend, connected via REST APIs.
